# noise-range-test

some scratch code and notes on output range of perlin noise

* [perlin improved](perlin-improved.md)
* [reshaping noise](reshaping.md)

Code is mostly just here so i can link parts of it when discussing it,
but to the extent it isn't a translation of someone else's code it is
MIT licensed if anyone manages to find any parts worth reusing.
